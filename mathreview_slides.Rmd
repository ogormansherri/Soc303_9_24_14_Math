## Fractions

* Fragment 
* Part of a whole
* Small part
* Bit or portion
* Designated by placing one number over another number
    * 2/5 or 9/12
* Composed of two pats:
    * Numerator (number above the line)
    * Denominator (number below the line)
* Always reduce the fraction when you can
    * `9/12 = 3/4`



## Decimals

Decimals are an amount that is less than one

* 1/10 = 0.10
* 1/100 = 0.01
* 1/1000 = 0.001

*This is important when we test for significance in statistics*



## Percentages

* The number of times something occurs every 100 times
* A specific rate followed by the % sign
* A proportion of a whole
* Converting decimal to percentage:
    * multiply the decimal by 100



## Rate

* A value or price (think gas price per gallon)
* A unit of something (think birthrate, cost of living, etc.)
* A ratio, proportion, or rank
* Usually expressed as a percentage



## Ratio

* Relationship between things 
* Relationship between numbers
* Reported as a fraction or numbers side by side
    * 2:10 is actually 2 out of 10 or 1 out of 5
* Can be reduced (as done above)

 

## Proportion

* A relationship of one portion to another
* A relationship to the whole
* A relationship of one thing to another
* A ratio in which the elements in the numerator must be included in the denominator




## Averaging: the Mean again!

* Average is the mean, in this class it is the arithmetic mean...it is not the median or mode!
* Computing is easy!
    * Add all the scores (numerator)
    * N = the number of items in the distribution (denominator)
* The equation: where $\Sigma$ is the sum 
    * $Average=\frac{\Sigma Scores}{N}$



## Rounding

* Rounding approximates the total final number
* Do not round until the very end of the process!
* Carried to indicates what decimal place is used
    * 2 decimal places = 13.01
* In this class: we use two or three decimal places meaning: REPORT THREE PLACES
    * 13.013
* If the answer is to the nearest whole number
    * Round up (if 5 and over) -> 13.5 = 14
    * Round down (if lower than 5) -> 14.3 = 14


    
    
## Converting Fractions to Percentages   

* Divide the numerator by the denominator
* Multiply by 100 
* Add a percent sign

`60/80 = 0.75 * 100 = 75%`



## Converting Ratio to Percentage

* Divide the numerator by the denominator
* Multiply the result (quotient) by 100
* Add a percent sign
* To change 1:8 to a percentage

`1/8 = 0.125 X 100 = 12.5%`



## Converting Decimals to Percentages

* Multiply the decimal by 100 (moves decimal point two places to the right)
* Add a percent sign
* Convert 0.75 to a percentage

`0.75 * 100 = 75%`



## Converting Percentages and Fractions   

* Remove the percent sign
* Place the percentage number in the numerator
* Place 100 in the denominator
* Convert to the lowest fraction
* Convert 25% to a fraction

`25/100 = 1/4`



## Computing with a Percentage            

* Convert the percent to a decimal
* Example 40% of 100 scores

`0.40 * 100 = 40`



## Converting other Units of Measure

* May need to convert metric to U.S. standards
* Data must be analyzed in the same units
* Linear Measures

Unit    | Conversion
--------|------------
1 cm    | 0.0328 foot; 0.3937 inch
1 inch  | 2.54 cm
1 foot  | 0.3048 meter
1 meter | 1.0936 yd; 3.2808 feet; 39.37 inches
1 mile  | 1.6094 km
1 km    | 0.6214 miles



## Weights and Liquids

* Weight Measures             
    * 1 gm = 0.0022 lb; 0.0353 oz 
    * 1 kg = 2.2046 lb            
    * 1 lb = 0.4536 kg; 45.36 gm  
    * 1 oz = 28.3495 gm           

* Liquid Measures
    * 1 quart = 0.94633 liter
    * 1 liter = 0.2642 gallons; 1.0567 quarts
